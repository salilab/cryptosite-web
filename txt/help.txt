<a name="input"><h4>Input Fields</h4></a>
<ul>
  <li><a id="email"><h5>Email</h5></a>
      <p>Required, a notification and results will be sent to this address once the job is completed.
      </p></li>
  <li><a id="input_pdb"><h5>Coordinate file</h5></a>
      <p>Provide PDB ID or upload input structure in the PDB format. Missing residues (eg, flexible loops)
         in the structure are NOT tolerated. For the best performance, please fill in the missing residues (for example, with Modeller). Please remove/edit non-natural amino acids, as they may crash your job.
      </p></li>
  <li><a id="chain"><h5>Chain ID</h5></a>
      <p>Required. CryptoSite can now use multiple chains as an input - please enter IDs of all the chains that you want to 
         analyze, separated by commas (for example, A,B,C).
      </p></li>
</ul>

<a name="output"><h4>Output Files</h4></a>
<ul>
  <li><b>cryptosite.pol.pred.pdb</b>: Output PDB file with CryptoSite scores in the B-factor column.
	                             We recommend using a score threshold of 10 (a residue with a larger score is
                                     more likely to be part of a cryptic site).</li>
  <li><b>cryptosite.pol.pred</b>: Output file in simple text format listing residues, residue IDs, chain IDs, and the CryptoSite score (last column; the number in PDB file divided by 100).</li>
  <li><b>cryptosite.chimerax</b>: UCSF Chimera session file that is preset to visualize you protein, with residues colored
                                  based on the CryptoSite score. A pop-up window will also appear when launching Chimera,
                                  showing feature values for all the selected residues.</li>
</ul>
